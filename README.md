TidePool in Java
============

This is a Java implementation of TidePool for Python.  TidePool is based off of the popular Python stratum mining server that is used on several mining pools.  

This is a work in progress.

Why?
-------

While the Python version 'does the job', it's code is very messy, error prone, and fails miserably when things go wrong. This is an attempt (and hopefully a successful one) to port the Python code into a cleaner, better, faster Java version. 

The switch itself to Java will result in a major performance boost and better maintainability.
